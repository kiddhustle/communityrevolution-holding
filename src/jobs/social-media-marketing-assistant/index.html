        <h2>About the job</h2>
        <p>
          We are currently recruiting for a social media marketing assistant
          [associate] to work within the marketing team of the social
          enterprise, which offers digital services to local SME’s, particularly
          those run by (or serving) the following groups:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Black ethnic minorities</li>

          <li>Groups suffering from digital exclusion</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We are looking for an individual who is passionate about technology
          (the web in particular), hands-on and eager to learn. The role is
          likely to involve working on multiple exciting projects (including the
          enterprise’s digital magazine) so the individual should be able to
          multi-task.
        </p>

        <p>Full training will be given to the successful candidate.</p>

        <h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Strategy: determining goals, the social media channels to be used,
            and the type of content that will be shared.
          </li>
          <li>
            Planning and Publishing: draft plans of what their content will look
            like (i.e. will there be videos? Photos? How much script?) and
            decide when it will be put out on the platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            Listening and Engagement: monitoring what users, customers, and
            others are saying about the posts, brands, and any other business
            assets. This may require the adoption of a social media engagement
            tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Analytics and Reporting: part of being on social media is knowing
            how far posts are going, so reports of engagement and reach are very
            important
          </li>
          <li>
            Advertising: purchasing ads on social media is a great way to
            promote and further develop a brand.

            Attending events and capturing footage to be published on social
            platforms
          </li>
        </ul>
