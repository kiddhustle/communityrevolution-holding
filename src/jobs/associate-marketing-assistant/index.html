          We are currently recruiting for an associate marketing assistant to
          work within the marketing team of the social enterprise, which offers
          digital services to local SME’s, particularly those run by (or

        <p>
          We are looking for an individual who is passionate about technology

          likely to involve working on multiple exciting projects (including the
          enterprise’s digital magazine) so the individual should be able to
          multi-task.

        <ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            Planning and Publishing: draft plans of what their content will look
            like (i.e. will there be videos? Photos? How much script?) and

          </li>
          <li>
            Listening and Engagement: monitoring what users, customers, and
            others are saying about the posts, brands, and any other business

            tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Analytics and Reporting: part of being on social media is knowing
            how far posts are going, so reports of engagement and reach are very
            important
          </li>
          <li>
            Advertising: purchasing ads on social media is a great way to
